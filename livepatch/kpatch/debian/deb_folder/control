Description: Runtime tools for Kpatch
 kpatch is a Linux dynamic kernel patching tool which allows you to patch a
 running kernel without rebooting or restarting any processes.  It enables
 sysadmins to apply critical security patches to the kernel immediately, without
 having to wait for long-running tasks to complete, users to log off, or
 for scheduled reboot windows.  It gives more control over up-time without
 sacrificing security or stability.
