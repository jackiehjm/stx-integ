 This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on August 14 1998
 so as to improve compatibility with GPL. This version ensures that W3C
 software licensing terms are no more restrictive than GPL and consequently
 W3C software may be distributed in GPL packages. See the older formulation
 for the policy prior to this date. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common
 questions about using materials from our site, including specific terms and
 conditions for packages like libwww, Amaya, and Jigsaw. Other questions
 about this notice can be directed to site-policy@w3.org.
